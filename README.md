# Grafana-Monitoring-Tool
Monitoring in Action: Real-Time Insights with Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter.
## Introduction to the Tools
### Grafana: 
A data visualization and alerting tool that connects to Prometheus to create dynamic and customizable dashboards for monitoring metrics.
### Prometheus:
An open-source monitoring tool used to collect, store, and query metrics data. It pulls in data from different sources (like Node Exporter) at regular intervals.
### Node Exporter:
A tool that provides system-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.) from the server or node itâ€™s installed on. This acts as a source of data for Prometheus.
## How the Tools Work Together
*Data Collection* Node Exporter collects system metrics from your server.
*Data Storage and Retrieval* Prometheus pulls metrics from Node Exporter and stores them. Prometheus also provides a query language (PromQL) for filtering and analyzing the metrics.
*Visualization* Grafana connects to Prometheus to retrieve these metrics and display them on custom dashboards. You can set up alerts in Grafana to notify you when specific conditions are met.
